  <h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>Uses PokeApi to reactively display an index of the first 151 Pokemon<p>
	<p>The user can search using either a number which identifies the Pokemon</p>
	<p>Information on each Pokemon's stats, types, descriptions, and in-game sprites are displayed upon search through the change of the page and the search bar</p>
	<p>The user can go through the index by search, clicking on the nav bar entries, or the arrow navs by the Pokemon images above the data</p>
	<p>Since there is only one Pokemon actively displayed at a time we used a drop down to display either the default or shiny in-game sprite</p>
	<p>The page meets the controls requirements as well as look uniform and displays the information in an organized manner</p>
	<p>The state of the page is seen by which Pokemon is actively displayed, shown by the number and name on top of the page, the middle Pokemon image in the arrow nav above the data and white text on the side nav</p>
	<p>Justin Vaughn did the design of the layout and color scheme of the page, as well as developed the navs and Stats section.</p> 
	<p>Justin Connolly built out the sections of Types, Sprites, and Flavor Text.</p>
	<p>The html, css, and javascript were edited by both members of the team collaborativly when we met throughout the process</p>
	<p>There is a problem with the flavor text, you need to select the desired pokemon twice</p>
